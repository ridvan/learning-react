# ⚛️ Learning React

I study [The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann** and code along with the instructor in this repository. I use [starter files](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course) of each project and complete them while following the course.
